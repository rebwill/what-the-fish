What the Fish?! allows the user to select a type of fish and receive information about the status of its population, challenges it is facing, and other factors to consider when purchasing or consuming fish.

Since we all are very far removed from the sources of the food that we eat, the goal of What the Fish?! is to help us know a bit more about what the fish we are consuming and what it actually was before it was filleted, frozen, and packaged in plastic to reach our plate.

It has a Node/Express back end and a React front end. The data is from Fishwatch.gov's public API.
